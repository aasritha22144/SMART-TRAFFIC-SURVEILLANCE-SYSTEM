This project presents a real-time, automated system for detecting traffic violations and accidents using surveillance video footage. The system integrates a deep learning-based computer vision pipeline comprising object detection, multi-object tracking, incident classification, license plate recognition, and traffic flow analysis. YOLOv8 is used for detecting various vehicle types, while Deep SORT and ByteTrack enable consistent tracking of individual vehicles across frames. A MobileNetV2 classifier is trained to recognize different types of accidents such as rear collisions, rollovers, and pedestrian hits based on a custom dataset of extracted video frames. License plate information is captured using EasyOCR, and vehicle speed is estimated through frame-by-frame motion analysis. The processed results including bounding boxes, IDs, speeds, and alerts are visualized directly on the video using OpenCV. This system offers a scalable, efficient, and accurate solution for enhancing road safety and enabling smarter traffic law enforcement through automated video surveillance.# SMART-TRAFFIC-SURVEILLANCE-SYSTEM
